///   game, because both in-play and finished games leave the board. And a line
///   still on the board means pre-game, which is never over, whatever the clock
///   or the book says.
/// * **The book says done**: no book at all, or one side bid at or above
///   `decided_bid`. A live game past the clock still shows a two-sided book
///   inside that bid and is left alone. A brand-new market with no book yet is
///   protected by the first fact, not this one: its kick-off is ahead.
